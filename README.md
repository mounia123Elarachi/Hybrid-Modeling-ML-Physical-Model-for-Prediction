# Hybrid-Modeling-ML-Physical-Model-for-Prediction
This report has presented a comprehensive investigation into the application of
a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the prediction of mineral concentrations. By integrating physics-driven constraints, the PINN demonstrates its
capacity to not only provide accurate predictions but also ensure adherence to
fundamental mass conservation laws.
The visual comparisons between PINN predictions and observed values underscore the model’s ability to capture the complexities of mineral compositions. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with a conventional Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) illuminates the added value of incorporating physics-informed regularization, showcasing the PINN’s superior performance in accurately predicting mineral
concentrations.
The study not only contributes to the advancement of predictive modeling in mineral processing but also highlights the potential for physics-informed approaches to
enhance the reliability and interpretability of machine learning models in complex
systems.
